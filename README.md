Description
Scripts underlying analysis in: Effect of crop production parameters on yield and harvest index simulated with LPJ-GUESS (version 4.1)
All the functions are performed for Maize and Wheat
-Ranges_Yi.R and Ranges_HI.R: Calculates and graph the variability caused by each parameter level including and excluding location variability for yield and harvest index, respectively.
-ANOVA_YI.R and ANOVA_HI.R: Run an analysis of variance to evaluate the variability assigned to parameters single effect and interactions for yield and harvest index, respectively. also graph the results
-Senescheck.R: Function to calculate the number of locations per setup with greater than 70% in maize and 50% in wheat of leaves senesced, separately for rainfed and irrigated
-Cost_functions.R:
